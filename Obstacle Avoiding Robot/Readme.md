## Obstacle Avoiding Robot

**Obstacle Avoiding Robot** is a simple autonomously guided robot that uses an ultrasonic sensor that scans for the obstacles and free path. It can measure the distance from the obstacle and send the signals to the Arduino. There are servo motors helping the sensor to look left and right while moving.

**Components:**
 - Arduino Uno
 - Breadboard
 - Ultrasonic Sensor
 - Two Gear Motors
 - H-bridge Motor Driver (L293D)
 - 9V Battery
 - Wires
